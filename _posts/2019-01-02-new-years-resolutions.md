The end of 2018 means has me -- like many others, reflecting on the past year and thinking about goals and intentions for 2019.  As a result, I'm taking a few minutes to jot down some things I really want to make a priority in 2019.


### 1. Taking care of my body and mind

This is more than just "I'm going to excercise more." Sure I want to get into better physical shape, but my real focus is on mental health. I plan to regularly meditate, and practice more yoga since it bridges the gap between mental and physical health. I'm going to be more deliberate about the food I put in my body, and I'm even going to focus on getting more sleep. I'm most worried about the sleep since I'm naturally a nightowl (it's 12:48am as I'm writing this).


### 2. Reading

I've always loved to read. It's an easy way to learn new things, stimulate creativity, and enhance emotional intelligence. Last year I read quite a bit, but I read in bursts. I'd read two books in as many weeks, then let a month go by before I picked up the next book on my shelf.

This year, I plan to read at least as many books as last year, but with an emphasis on reading works from diverse authors. I'll still read both fiction and nonfiction, but more of those books will be written by women and/or people of color to help broaden my point of view, and challenge my perception of the world.


### 3. Writing

I've always wanted to start blogging, but never took the leap. This year I'm finally going to start, but you already know that because you're reading this. I plan to write primarily about Swift and iOS developement, but I may sprinking in reflections about a book I've read or thoughts/learnings from some event in my life. 

I'm still not sure exactly how often I'll write, what the cadence will be, but I'd like to use this as a way of collecting and sharing my thoughts in the event they can help others.


### 4. Grow as a Leader

Last year I transitioned into a technical lead role.



### Wrapping up...

So now that I've written these things on the internet, I _have_ to follow through (that's the idea at least).

Are there any particular topics you'd like to see me write about? If so, let me know on twitter at [@nickffox](https://www.twitter.com/nickffox)!

# Draft post about mental benefits of teammates and mental health.







2018 was a busy year. The only other iOS engineer at LiveSafe left, leaving me as the only mobile engineer working on iOS. Don't get me wrong, I was excited to step up and own both our core iOS app and our SDK, but I definitely underestimated the stress that came along with this. I became responsible for every bugfix, every feature, and answering every question our sales or implementation teams had. Every research spike or 

an application of our size as well as a mobile SDK was exciting, but now I feel that view was naieve.
