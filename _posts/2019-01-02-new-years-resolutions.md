The start of 2019 has me reflecting on the past year and thinking about intentions and goals for the new year. To clarify, I view an intention as a broader theme, where a goal has more clearly defined criteria. I have a tendency to be a bit hard on myself, so I like a mix of intentions and goals. Intentions are more thematic than concrete, so 

I figured rather than tweeting these, I'd get started on one of them by pulling together this blog post. I'll start with my personal goals because I'm a person before I'm an engineer.




## Personal Goals

### 1. Take care of my body and mind

This is more than just "I'm going to excercise more." Sure I want to get back into physical shape, but my _real_ focus is on mental health. I plan to regularly meditate, and practice more yoga since it really bridges the gap between mental and physical health. I'm going to be more deliberate about the food I eat, and even though I'm a night owl, I'm going to focus on getting more sleep.


### 2. Read more

I already read quite a bit, but I want to keep that up. Reading is an easy way to learn new things, stimulate creativity, and enhance emotional intelligence. Last year, I read in bursts. I'd read two books in as many weeks, then let a month go by before I picked up the next book on my shelf. This year I'd like to be more consistent. 

I plan to read at least as many books as last year, but with an emphasis on reading works from diverse authors. I'll still read both fiction and nonfiction, but more of those books will be written by women and/or people of color to help me experience diverse perspectives view and challenge my view of the world.


### 3. Start to write

I've always wanted to start blogging, but never took the leap. This year I'm finally going to start, but you already know that because you're reading this. I plan to write primarily about Swift and iOS developement, but I'll likely sprinkle in reflections on books I've read or other random ideas that I have. 

I'm not sure exactly how often I'll write, but I plan to use this as a way of collecting, organizing, and sharing my thoughts in the event they can help others.


### 4. Take more photos

On weekends, I used to bike around DC taking pictures of art, life in the city, and architecture. Work got busy enough last year that I lost a bit of my work/life balance, and photography was one of the first things to go. I miss it, so this year I'm going to start taking pictures on the weekends again. Maybe I'll occasionally share some of them here.


## Professional/Technical Goals

### Learn more about accessibility

I've spent a few years building apps, but I've never really taken the time to learn about Apple's accessibility APIs. Part of building a great product is making sure _everyone_ can use it, so I 


### Strive to be a "Product Engineer"

I'm incredibly passionate about building great products, and I want my work to show that. I want to advocate for our users, and fight to the right thing, not just the easy thing. If that means spending an extra few days tweaking an animation to make it just right, that's 


### Serve as a force multiplier

These next two are a bit more g


### Share my knowledge

Two years ago, I gave a brief talk about dependency injection at the local Cocoaheads meetup here in DC. It was terrifying, but I survived it. In line with my goal of being a force-multiplier, I want to share what I've learned with others, and speaking is a great way to do that. I want to practice that skill by putting together and giving at least one technical talk this year. 


### Revive My Side Project

I almost didn't add this one... I already spend a lot of time writing code



# Wrapping up...

So now that I've written these things on the internet, I _have_ to follow through (that's the idea at least).

Are there any particular topics you'd like to see me write about? If so, let me know on twitter at [@nickffox](https://www.twitter.com/nickffox)!

# Draft post about mental benefits of teammates and mental health.







2018 was a busy year. The only other iOS engineer at LiveSafe left, leaving me as the only mobile engineer working on iOS. Don't get me wrong, I was excited to step up and own both our core iOS app and our SDK, but I definitely underestimated the stress that came along with this. I became responsible for every bugfix, every feature, and answering every question our sales or implementation teams had. Every research spike or 

an application of our size as well as a mobile SDK was exciting, but now I feel that view was naieve.
